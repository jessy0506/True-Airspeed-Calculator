I made this tool myself for VATSIM flying.
When I am doing a flight where I try to match the real-life one, flying the exact same route, this tool can be handy in finding out what the true airspeed is of the flight you are doing.
Basically you take the groundspeed from the IRL flight (for example flightradar or adsbexchange) and input it in the tool. Then take wind speed and true heading from your aircraft (judging that you are using realtime weather) and also input in into the tool.
Now you will know what true airspeed the IRL flight is flying, and you can accelerate or decelerate to match it's mach number.
